      <h3>You stumble out of a dark dungeon and you are face to face with a huge Dragon. You have two choices.</h3>
      <br />
      <p>You can either grab your backpack and gear and run as fast as you can towards the nearest town.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>or...</h3>
      <br />
      <p>Or you can draw your sword, pray to the gods and face the Dragon in battle.</p>
